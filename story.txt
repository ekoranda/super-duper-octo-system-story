This is a story about a very grumpy cat named Max. 
One day a family found a very friendly cat on their porch. He followed them 
around the block and begged to be pet. After a week of sleeping on thier 
porch they let Max come into their house to eat some food. Max was a very
thick cat, someone magically even though he was homeless at the time, and was 
appretiative to get fed. Although the family tried to get in contact with 
Max's old owners, they did not want him back, and the family adopted him. 
The family grew very attatched to the cuddly, friendly cat however after
a few weeks they started to understand why his old owners would not take
him back... 

The family did not want Max back because he ate all of the best food. He was a smart cat, and learned to open cupboards and packages, managing to eat all of the treats the family kept in the house. Each day they would hide their treats before leaving for work, and when they returned home they had already been found and eaten. SO they had to come up with a solution..

One day, while Max was sleeping, the family dumped a trail of treats outside of the house and into the backyard. They hoped that max would follow the trail of treats so that they could lock him out. However, Max was too clever to fall for this, and while the family was pouring the trail, Max pushed the door shut and locked the family out out their house. Max would only let them back in when they resolved to give him more treats...

Max was very happy with his new treats. His family grew to love his funny little quirks and would never think of giving him up again. He may be a fat little cat, but he loves his family very much. Although he needs to work on his anger manegment issues when it comes to being fed, Max lives a happy life living in his families home.
